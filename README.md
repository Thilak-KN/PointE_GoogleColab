# PointE_GoogleColab
Tried the Point-E (Generative AI for 3D models) in Google Colab

The Python Notebook has code for generating Point Cloud from Text/Image & viewing it, and also code for exporting it to 3D model.

Thanks to the CGMatter YouTube channel for introducing new Python libraries to view 3D models natively inside Google Colab :)
